# FSG-DataProtocol
The Data-Transfer-Protocol made by the [FSG-Pfullingen](http://fsg-pfullingen.de/) Computer Science Club 2017.

This Library is made, so it only uses 2 wires to connunicate (okay, actually 4 to make it work in both directions, but to send you only need 2).

## Info
Tested Successfully on two [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/).
